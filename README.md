Software vulnerability prediction models represent a promising approach in security defect analysis, since they allow to focus testing and improve software quality. Several studies have proposed Machine Learning approaches which demonstrated satisfying performance when evaluated using K-fold Cross-validation. However, recent research demonstrated that, when applying a release-based validation strategy instead, the performance declined. We want to investigate this issue, by conducting a comparative study on different models and dataset. We analyze the impact of using a relase-based validation approach on vulnerability prediction models formerly evaluated using cross-validation. We rely on an existing dataset to evaluate two prediction models that exploit code metrics and textual features, respectively. We confirm that the release-based validation approach leads to generally lower performance, highlighting that further research would be needed to make vulnerability prediction models more effective.
