To run our scripts, you will need Python 3. \
You can run execute_replication.py to store in the replication.csv file the results of our study. \
You can also choose to run execute_custom_experiments.py. You will be asked to choose experiments settings, i.e., if you want to work with software metrics or text tokens, by applying cross-validation or a release-based approach. In the latter, you will also be asked to choose which releases to use in training and testing phases, respectively. A new file experiments.csv will be created to store the results of your custom experiments.
