Here you can find the results of our experiments.
In order to make the comparison straightforward, we plot in the same figure the performance output by the same model when evaluated with the two different methods, i.e., cross-validation and release-based. The dots indicate the performance obtained in 3-fold cross-validation, the box plots summarize the performance collected in all the rounds of release-based validation.

Figure "metrics_none" shows the performance of the model based on software metrics on the unbalanced dataset. \
Figures "metrics_undersampling" and "metrics_oversampling" summarize the performance of the model based on software metrics on the dataset balanced with undersampling and oversampling, respectively. \
Figures "text_none", "text_undersampling" and "text_oversampling" are referred to the model based on text tokens.
